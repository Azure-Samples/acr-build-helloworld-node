# Tutorial: Build and deploy container images in the cloud with Azure Container Registry Tasks

[ACR Tasks](container-registry-tasks-overview.md) is a suite of features within Azure Container Registry that provides streamlined and efficient Docker container image builds in Azure. In this article, you learn how to use the *quick task* feature of ACR Tasks.

The "inner-loop" development cycle is the iterative process of writing code, building, and testing your application before committing to source control. A quick task extends your inner-loop to the cloud, providing you with build success validation and automatic pushing of successfully built images to your container registry. Your images are built natively in the cloud, close to your registry, enabling faster deployment.

All your Dockerfile expertise is directly transferrable to ACR Tasks. You don't have to change your Dockerfiles to build in the cloud with ACR Tasks, just the command you run. 

In this tutorial, part one of a series:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Get the sample application source code
> * Build a container image in Azure
> * Deploy a container to Azure Container Instances

In subsequent tutorials, you learn to use ACR Tasks for automated container image builds on code commit and base image update. ACR Tasks can also run [multi-step tasks](container-registry-tasks-multi-step.md), using a YAML file to define steps to build, push, and optionally test multiple containers.

## Prerequisites :

### 1.A  GitHub account

Create github account https://github.com.


### 1.B Fork sample repository

Menggunakan GitHub UI untuk melakukan fork dari sample repo ke local repo. 

Fork this repository: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/acr-build-helloworld-node

![Screenshot of the Fork button (highlighted) in GitHub][quick-build-01-fork]
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23251706/146666248-ce7dd6d9-3fde-46c3-8195-21e11ef9da25.png)


### 1.C Clone your fork

Once you've forked the repo, clone your fork and enter the directory containing your local clone.

Clone the repo with `git`, replace **\<your-github-username\>** with your GitHub username:

```console
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/acr-build-helloworld-node
```

Enter the directory containing the source code:

```console
cd acr-build-helloworld-node
```

## 1.D Build in Azure with ACR Tasks (VIsual Studio Code)

Membuat Resource group dan Azure Container Registry.
Note : 
Ganti $RES_GROUP dengan nama resource group yang mudah untuk diingat
Ganti $ACR_NAME dengan nama Azure Container Registry yang mudah untuk diingat
Lokasi : Southeastasia

```azurecli
RES_GROUP=$ACR_NAME # Resource Group name

az group create --resource-group $RES_GROUP --location southeastasia
az acr create --resource-group $RES_GROUP --name $ACR_NAME --sku Standard --location southeastasia
```

Now that you have a registry, use ACR Tasks to build a container image from the sample code. Execute the [az acr build][az-acr-build] command to perform a *quick task*.

[!INCLUDE [pull-image-dockerfile-include](../../includes/pull-image-dockerfile-include.md)]

```azurecli
az acr build --registry $ACR_NAME --image helloacrtasks:v1 .
```

Output from the [az acr build][az-acr-build] command is similar to the following. You can see the upload of the source code (the "context") to Azure, and the details of the `docker build` operation that the ACR task runs in the cloud. Because ACR tasks use `docker build` to build your images, no changes to your Dockerfiles are required to start using ACR Tasks immediately.

Near the end of the output, ACR Tasks displays the dependencies it's discovered for your image. This enables ACR Tasks to automate image builds on base image updates, such as when a base image is updated with OS or framework patches. You learn about ACR Tasks support for base image updates later in this tutorial series.

## Deploy to Azure Container Instances

ACR tasks automatically push successfully built images to your registry by default, allowing you to deploy them from your registry immediately.

In this section, you create an Azure Key Vault and service principal, then deploy the container to Azure Container Instances (ACI) using the service principal's credentials.

### Configure registry authentication

All production scenarios should use [service principals][service-principal-auth] to access an Azure container registry. Service principals allow you to provide role-based access control to your container images. For example, you can configure a service principal with pull-only access to a registry.

#### Create a key vault

If you don't already have a vault in [Azure Key Vault](../key-vault/index.yml), create one with the Azure CLI using the following commands.

```azurecli
AKV_NAME=$ACR_NAME-vault

az keyvault create --resource-group $RES_GROUP --name $AKV_NAME
```

#### Create a service principal and store credentials

You now need to create a service principal and store its credentials in your key vault.

Use the [az ad sp create-for-rbac][az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac] command to create the service principal, and [az keyvault secret set][az-keyvault-secret-set] to store the service principal's **password** in the vault. Use Azure CLI version **2.25.0** or later for these commands:

```azurecli
# Create service principal, store its password in AKV (the registry *password*)
az keyvault secret set \
  --vault-name $AKV_NAME \
  --name $ACR_NAME-pull-pwd \
  --value $(az ad sp create-for-rbac \
                --name $ACR_NAME-pull \
                --scopes $(az acr show --name $ACR_NAME --query id --output tsv) \
                --role acrpull \
                --query password \
                --output tsv)
```

The `--role` argument in the preceding command configures the service principal with the *acrpull* role, which grants it pull-only access to the registry. To grant both push and pull access, change the `--role` argument to *acrpush*.

Next, store the service principal's *appId* in the vault, which is the **username** you pass to Azure Container Registry for authentication:

```azurecli
# Store service principal ID in AKV (the registry *username*)
az keyvault secret set \
    --vault-name $AKV_NAME \
    --name $ACR_NAME-pull-usr \
    --value $(az ad sp list --display-name $ACR_NAME-pull --query [].appId --output tsv)
```

You've created an Azure Key Vault and stored two secrets in it:

* `$ACR_NAME-pull-usr`: The service principal ID, for use as the container registry **username**.
* `$ACR_NAME-pull-pwd`: The service principal password, for use as the container registry **password**.

You can now reference these secrets by name when you or your applications and services pull images from the registry.

### Deploy a container with Azure CLI

Now that the service principal credentials are stored as Azure Key Vault secrets, your applications and services can use them to access your private registry.

Execute the following [az container create][az-container-create] command to deploy a container instance. The command uses the service principal's credentials stored in Azure Key Vault to authenticate to your container registry.

```azurecli
az container create \
    --resource-group $RES_GROUP \
    --name acr-tasks \
    --image $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io/helloacrtasks:v1 \
    --registry-login-server $ACR_NAME.azurecr.io \
    --registry-username $(az keyvault secret show --vault-name $AKV_NAME --name $ACR_NAME-pull-usr --query value -o tsv) \
    --registry-password $(az keyvault secret show --vault-name $AKV_NAME --name $ACR_NAME-pull-pwd --query value -o tsv) \
    --dns-name-label acr-tasks-$ACR_NAME \
    --query "{FQDN:ipAddress.fqdn}" \
    --output table
```

The `--dns-name-label` value must be unique within Azure, so the preceding command appends your container registry's name to the container's DNS name label. The output from the command displays the container's fully qualified domain name (FQDN), for example:

```output
FQDN
----------------------------------------------
acr-tasks-myregistry.eastus.azurecontainer.io
```

Take note of the container's FQDN, you'll use it in the next section.

### Verify the deployment

To watch the startup process of the container, use the [az container attach][az-container-attach] command:

```azurecli
az container attach --resource-group $RES_GROUP --name acr-tasks
```

The `az container attach` output first displays the container's status as it pulls the image and starts, then binds your local console's STDOUT and STDERR to that of the container.

```output
Container 'acr-tasks' is in state 'Running'...
(count: 1) (last timestamp: 2020-11-18 18:39:10+00:00) pulling image "myregistry.azurecr.io/helloacrtasks:v1"
(count: 1) (last timestamp: 2020-11-18 18:39:15+00:00) Successfully pulled image "myregistry.azurecr.io/helloacrtasks:v1"
(count: 1) (last timestamp: 2020-11-18 18:39:17+00:00) Created container
(count: 1) (last timestamp: 2020-11-18 18:39:17+00:00) Started container

Start streaming logs:
Server running at http://localhost:80
```

When `Server running at http://localhost:80` appears, navigate to the container's FQDN in your browser to see the running application. The FQDN should have been displayed in the output of the `az container create` command you executed in the previous section.

To detach your console from the container, hit `Control+C`.

## Clean up resources

Stop the container instance with the [az container delete][az-container-delete] command:

```azurecli
az container delete --resource-group $RES_GROUP --name acr-tasks
```

To remove *all* resources you've created in this tutorial, including the container registry, key vault, and service principal, issue the following commands. These resources are used in the [next tutorial](container-registry-tutorial-build-task.md) in the series, however, so you might want to keep them if you move on directly to the next tutorial.

```azurecli
az group delete --resource-group $RES_GROUP
az ad sp delete --id http://$ACR_NAME-pull
```

## Next steps

Now that you've tested your inner loop with a quick task, configure a **build task** to trigger container images builds when you commit source code to a Git repository:
